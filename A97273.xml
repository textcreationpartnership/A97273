            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many things are purpoſely omitted (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the former part) for brevity ſake, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might have been inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For his intentions at firſt, were to leave it in the Regiſter book of his Pariſh (in which he firſt began it) for the uſe of his ſucceſſors; but it growing too big for that deſign, he drew the reſt down in papers to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of General <hi>Monck,</hi> and the happy Reſtitution of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second
<pb facs="tcp:116047:3"/>to his Throne.

His purpoſe only is to ſet forth the ſtupendious mercy of God in raiſing up a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Saviour (ſuch a one he accounts General <hi>Monck</hi> to be) for the deliverance of this ſinful Nation, from

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116047:5"/>the King, the Parliament it ſelf, and thee Kindoms.</p>
            <p>The King in the beginning of this Parliament, had for the ſecurity of the Subjects in their Perſons, Liberties, and Eſtates, paſſed many and ſeveral Acts of grace, (to the no ſmall dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his Royal Prerogative) more than all his Predeceſſors Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> from the Conqueſt downward, had ever done; and all this to remove from them all jealouſies and fears.</p>
            <p>After this in <hi>May,</hi> 1641. he gives way at the great and preſſing importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Houſe of Commons,<note place="margin">

The King was very hardly moved to yield either to his attaindor or execution, as not being ſatisfied in conſcience, of any guilt or crime in him, deſerving ſuch puniſhment, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116047:5"/>yield at length he did (though with much reluctancy) to ſatisfie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the people, and indeed at the requeſt of the Earle himſelf; who deſired <hi>Jonah</hi>-like, <hi>to be caſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,</hi> thereby to appeaſe the violent rage of a tempeſtuous people. The truth is, this Nobleman, as alſo the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (afterwards <hi>Anno</hi> 1644.) were meerly ſacrificed to the malice and revenge of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the King goes into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to compoſe differences there, between himſelf and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Kingdom: which done, he returns again to <hi>London,</hi> and is there received with exceeding joy and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of the people, in or about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Majeſty home, inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him thanks for the many gracious Acts he had lately paſſed, they preſent him with a Remonſtrance, <hi>Dec.</hi> 15.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116047:6"/>laying open all the miſcarriages and misfortunes of his whole Government, from the beginning of his Raign, even to that preſent; and this they publiſh, contrary to his expreſs deſire, to the whole Kingdom; whereby they gave occaſion to the people, to conceive jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and ſuſpicions of a malignant party about the King, ſtill carrying on their own deſigns, both againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>After the publiſhing of this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, fears and jealouſies encreaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people; the vulgar rabble in and about <hi>London,</hi> frequently flock down to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with Petitions and clamours, againſt the Biſhops and Popiſh Lords, and diſaffected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (as they termed them) in the Houſe of Commons, and no redreſs could be had again them, though the Houſe of Lords and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had moved the Houſe of Commons to declare againſt them. The truth is, they were favored and countenanced
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116047:6"/>under hand, by ſome Members of that Houſe.</p>
            <p>The King to avoid the danger of theſe tumults, withdraws from <hi>White-hall</hi> to <hi>Windſor;</hi> from thence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> into the Northern parts; and thence to <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament ſoon after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> petition Him, at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and elſewhere, for the Militia, to have it put into ſuch hands as the two Houſes ſhall think fit; but he denyes them: telling them that the Law hath ſetled it in Him; that to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Himſelf of the power of the Sword, is to bereave Himſelf of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to protect his people, and ſupport the Laws. This Petition was much inſiſted on by the Parliament under pretence of feares and jealouſies; but the King abſolutely and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily denyes it.</p>
            <p>The King by ſeveral journeys comes <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1642</label>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:116047:7"/>to <hi>York,</hi> in the beginning of the year 1642, and there he ſettles His Court. Soon after his coming into thoſe parts, he was denyed enterance into <hi>Hull</hi> by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> when he offer'd to go into the Town but with twenty perſons attending Him; The King thereupon fearing, leſt the ſame armed force that kept Him out of <hi>Hull,</hi> might ſurprize His Perſon at <hi>York,</hi> he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a guard of the Gentry of that County. This by the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is Voted a levying of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament, though they themſelves had long before, three times as many of the <hi>Trainedbands</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to guard the houſes dayly.</p>
            <p>Many Petitions, Anſwers, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, paſſed between the King and Parliament, during his Majeſties being at <hi>York,</hi> wherein it is evident to all underſtanding men, that the King had the better cauſe, and was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain it by the pen, and by reaſons and arguments, than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116047:7"/>was; for the truth is, his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Anſwers to their Meſſages, Petitions, and Propoſitions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable.</p>
            <p>But words and writings not being ſufficient to compoſe theſe differences, they proceed from words to blows: About <hi>July,</hi> they Vote that the King is ſeduced by evill and Malignant Counſellers, and thereupon they Vote an Army to be raiſed under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Robert Earle</hi> of <hi>Eſsex;</hi> the pretence is for King and Parliament, againſt theſe Malignant Counſellers; but they accuſe or name none in particular.</p>
            <p>The ſame year, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. the King ſets up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> commanding all men who were bound to aſſiſt him by vertue of their Tenures, to repair unto him. But at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> there being no great appearance (though <hi>Eſsex</hi> his Army was at that time liſted, and formed ready to march) his Majeſty marches with thoſe few Forces he had to <hi>Leiceſter, Worceſter,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116047:8"/>Shrewsbury,</hi> and ſo upon the borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> gathering an Army; <hi>Eſſex</hi> all this time marching <hi>after him,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him.</p>
            <p>After ſome little conflict at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> wherein the Kings Forces under the conduct of <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> &amp; <hi>Maurice</hi> had the better, the two Armies meet at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> near <hi>Keynton</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where the firſt Signal Battel was fought between them, with great loſſe and ſlaughter on either ſide: The Kings ſtandard being taken, yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again; his General the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> ſlain; but the King had the better, keeping the field all night; and <hi>Eſsex</hi> Retreating with his broken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>Warwick-Caſtle,</hi> and from thence ſoon after with a few horſes to <hi>London:</hi> This Battel was fought on Sunday <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. and the Guns were heard all that afternoon to <hi>Thetford</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King preſently after enters <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and fortifies it, and matches to

               <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſo towards <hi>London;</hi> The Citizens arming and ſending forth all the power they could make againſt him. At <hi>Branford</hi> he encountred them about <hi>Novem.</hi> 12. and beat the party that oppoſed; but fearing leaſt he ſhould be ſurrounded with their numerous Army of Citizens, he Retreated back to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Reading,</hi> he marches back to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> but about the latter end of the year <hi>Reading</hi> is beſieged by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Forces, and the Governour Sir <hi>Arthur Aſhton</hi> being unhappily wounded with a brick falling from a Chimney beaten down by a Canon-ſhot, the Gariſon is yeilded upon compoſition by <hi>Colonel Fielding.</hi>

            <p>The Houſe of Lords upon preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Petitions, were pleaſed to grant their deſires, revoking the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the 23 of <hi>July,</hi> and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that of the fourth of <hi>May.</hi> The debate ſtuck longer in the Houſe of Commons, but about three of the clock in the Afternoon, they paſſed it; The Apprentices ſtaying in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment door, till the Vote was paſſed; and then all or the moſt part withdrew and went to their homes.</p>

            <p>On the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, the day before they were to meet upon the adjournment, the Speaker with about fourty of the Members, ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to the Army then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> complaining of an horrid force put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Houſe. The reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at leaſt 140, meeting on the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning according to adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finding neither Speaker, nor Mace, and underſtanding upon inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whither he was gone, they choſe a New Speaker, and get another Mace, and ſet againe; and the like did the Lords, whoſe Speaker alſo was fled upon the ſame account: both (as it was conceived) either inveigled, or threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the Army, that they might have the better pretence of quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the City and Parliament. I have related this paſſage the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that it may be compared with the force afterward put upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116047:19"/>by the Army themſelves, upon the King Tryal.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus paſſed as <hi>London</hi> between the Parliament and City, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed the Army, who now take upon them, to be Supream Umpires o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nation; they entertain and countenance the fugitive Speakers and Members, and they and the Council of the Army, ſet together in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, engaging to ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this quarrel againſt the members (as they termed them) at <hi>Weſtminiſter,</hi> and the City.</p>
            <p>Mean time the Parliament call in the eleven impeached Members, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hitherto upon the Armies accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they revive the Committee of Safety, they give power to the City by ſeveral Orders and Ordinances, to liſt and raiſe Forces, to appoint Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Commanders, to iſſue out Armes and Ammunition, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Parliament and City, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that ſhould invade them.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116047:20"/>
               <hi>Maſsey, Pointze, Birch,</hi> and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes that had formerly done great ſervice for the Parliament when <hi>Eſſex</hi> was General, are now imployed as chief Commanders for the City. The Army on the contrary drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all their Forces, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to raiſe the <hi>Trained bands</hi> in the adjacent Counties, prepare and intend to invade and ſubdue that Rebellious City.</p>
            <p>The City thus prepared for defence, were nevertheleſs, for preventing the effuſion of blood, willing to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with the Army upon any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms; and to that purpoſe ſent ſeveral meſſages to the Army; but all would not do, no terms of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or peace would be granted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would ſubmit themſelves, and the Parliament, wholly to the power of the Army; which upon the point they did; for in concluſion they agree and yield, To deſert both Houſes of Parliament and the impeached Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116047:20"/>To recall their Declaration late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed, Relinquiſh their <hi>Militia,</hi> deliver up all their Forts and line of Communication to the Army, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with all Armes and Ammunition therein; to disband all their Forces, and turn all their new-made Commanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes out of the line, to demoliſh all their works, and to ſuffer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to march without oppoſition through the City.</p>
            <p>Theſe imperious conditions of the Army, were calmly ſubmitted to by the tame-ſpirited <hi>Citizens:</hi> And thereupon, the Army brings in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Speakers and Members, and ſeat them again in their authority; <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> receives the ſolemn thanks of the Houſe, the common ſouldiers two months pay for their good ſervice and valour, and a day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is appointed, to be ſolemnly kept for this great deliverance: and <hi>Fairfax</hi> made General of all Forces, both in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116047:21"/>
               <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and Conſtable of the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> All this was done, <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1647.</p>
            <p>Soon after the General, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, and the whole Army, with their train of Artillery, march in triumph through the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> And from that day forward, both City, Parliament, and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are ſubject to the Army.</p>
            <p>Not long after the reſtitution of theſe fugitive Members, all Votes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Ordinances of Parliament, made in their abſence, are declared null and void: The eleven impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, have leave granted them to go beyond Sea, and they muſt think they are favourably dealt with: Seven Lords that ſate in the upper Houſe, in the abſence of the fugitive Members, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Suffolk, Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Midleſex;</hi> the Lords <hi>Berkly, Willoughby, Hunſdon,</hi> and <hi>Maynard,</hi> are impeached of high Treaſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116047:21"/>to the black Rod, for levying of War againſt the King, Parliament, and Kingdom. The Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, and divers Citizens, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impeached of the ſame crime, and committed to the Tower; divers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alſo of the Commons Houſe, are under accuſation and examination, as countenancers and abettors of the late tumult. But all theſe impeachments and accuſations, in time vaniſhed, and came to nothing; only the Army Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was by this means ſtrengthened and encouraged, and the other party as much quell'd and diſcouraged; ſo that thenceforward all Votes propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were paſſed or not, according to the temper and diſpoſition of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Parliament became wholly ſubſervient to the Armies deſigns, as will plainly appeare in the enſuing Story.</p>
            <p>Meantime the King continues ſtill under the power of the Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and paſſes from place to place
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116047:22"/>as they remove their Quarters: But now having made the Parliament wholly for their turn, he is removed nearer <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Hampton Court;</hi> there he had much freedom, and abundance of people continually reſorted to him. At <hi>Hampton Court</hi> he receives Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from the Parliament, <hi>Septem.</hi> 7. the ſame in effect that were tendred to him at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in <hi>July</hi> the year before. The King in anſwer, deſires that the Parliament would take into conſideration the Propoſals of the Army, of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1647. as more moderate, and more conducing to ſatisfie all intereſts in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Things thus ſtanding, and the King remaining ſtill at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> a Faction of Seditious people called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, ſprung up in the City and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> ſome of the chiefeſt whereof were <hi>Lilburn, Overton, VVyldman,</hi> and others, people of a turbulent and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116047:22"/>temper. Theſe frame a writing, called <hi>the Agreement of the people,</hi> tending to the alteration of the whole frame of Government of the Nation. They ſtile the Houſe of Commons in their Petitions, the supreme power of the Nation; they bitterly declaim and raile againſt the Houſe of Lords in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pamphlets. Theſe at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome check from the Houſe of Commons; and one of them (a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) is by the Council of War, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and ſhot to death at <hi>VVare:</hi> but yet they increaſe more and more, and grow more inſolent every day, being (as is was probably thought) counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced underhand by ſome in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and by ſome great Officers in the Army, to promote their own ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſigns. At length about <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 9. or 10. <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſends word to the King by Colonel <hi>VVhaley</hi> who had the Guard of him, that thoſe kind of people were grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous in the Army, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116047:23"/>he feared they had ſome malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt his Majeſties perſon, and he doubted it would not be in the power of the Officers of the Army to protect him, and therefore adviſed him, by timely withdrawing himſelf in private, to provide for his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; A Letter of Advertiſement alſo from an unknown perſon in <hi>London</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, was ſent and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his Majeſty, intimating his danger, and wiſhing his Majeſty were at his or any Loyal Subjects Houſe in <hi>London:</hi> Whereupon the next day in the Evening, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 11. his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty with a Servant or two only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed himſelf ſecretly from <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Court,</hi> into the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that Iſland commanded one <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Hamond,</hi> as Governour there for the Parliament; a kinſman he was of Dr. <hi>Hamonds,</hi> that famous Divine, and (I think) the Kings Chaplain; inſomuch as the King might expect ſome more then ordinary civility from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116047:23"/>him. <hi>Hamond</hi> preſently gives notice to the Parliament of his Majeſties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, and upon order from the Parliament, takes him into cuſtody at <hi>Curesbrook Caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King alſo upon his departure from <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> had left upon the Table a Letter or Meſſage to the two Houſes of Parliament, ſignifying the cauſe of his withdrawing himſelf, and alſo his readineſs to concurre with them in all things juſt and reaſonable, for the ſettling of a ſafe and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Peace. And had further ſoon after his arrival in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> ſent another Meſſage or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to them, wherein he offers, Firſt, <hi>Concerning Religion to eſtabliſh the Presbyterian Government for three years, and then afterwards to establiſh Church-Government in ſuch a manner as ſhall be concluded upon by the Aſſembly of Divines, with the addition of twenty Divines to be nominated by his Majeſty.</hi> Secondly, <hi>For the Militia he offers it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116047:24"/>them wholly by Land and Sea, during his whole Raign, ſo as after that, it may return intirely to the Crown.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>For the arrears of the Army, he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, if he may have the benefit of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations from <hi>March</hi> laſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to be made before the concluſion of the Peace, and the Aſſiſtance of the Clergy, and the arreares of the Rents of his own revenew, that were yet behinde; to pay</hi> 400 <hi>thouſand pound within eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months; and if that will not do, then to make ſale of forreſt Lands for raiſing the reſt.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>He gives them power to diſpoſe of the great Offices of State, as alſo to nominate and appoint his Privy Counſellours during his raign.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>For the Court of Wards, if it cannot be regulated without being a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to his Subjects, he is willing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh it, for a valuable compenſation.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>He offers to recall and null all Proclamations and Declarations againſt the Parliament, and all Indictments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any perſon for adhering to them,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116047:24"/>or acting by their authority; and to paſs an Act of general pardon and Oblivion to all his Subjects whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe and ſome other things he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers by that Maſſage of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 17. and for all other things, he deſires they may be debated and compoſed in a perſonal Treaty, between himſelf and the two Houſes of Parliament at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Which perſonal Treaty the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners ſoon after deſired to be aſſented to, and held forth his Majeſties offers to be very juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>But to this Maſſage of his Majeſty the two Houſes return anſwer, by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him four Bills to ſign and confirm under the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> 1. <hi>To ſettle the Militia by ſea and land, both in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in the two Houſes of Parliament for ever; with power to raiſe what Forces they pleaſe; as alſo what moneys they thought good, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subjects, for ſupport thereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diveſting the Court wholly of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116047:25"/>of the Militia.</hi> 2. <hi>To juſtifie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Parliament in the late War, and to make void all Oaths, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Proclamations, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt the Parliament.</hi> 3. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Peeres lately made or to be made without conſent of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 4. <hi>For the adjournment of the Parliament from place to place, as the two houſes ſhould think fit. Theſe Bills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſsented to, and confirmed by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, they will yield to treat with him concerning the reſt of the propoſitions in the Iſle of</hi> Wight. Which propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I muſt further tell you, were ſuch as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners declared their diſſent upon them, before they were ſent.</p>
            <p>The King apprehending theſe four Bills eſpecially in the way they were penn'd, not only deſtructive to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but to the peoples libertie, refuſes to confirm them; yet in a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or writing to the Houſes, gave his reaſons againſt them.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:116047:25"/>
            <p>Whereupon the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preſently Vote to make no more addreſſes to him, but to ſettle the Kingdom without him: and further by the ſame Vote, they make it high Treaſon, for any perſon whatfoever, to ſend any Meſſage or Letter to him, or to receive any from him, without conſent of both Houſes of Parliament. This was about the beginning of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe of Lords would not be drawn ſuddenly to paſs theſe Votes; divers argued ſtrongly againſt them; and the Houſe was equally divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the queſtion; but within three or four dayes after, the Army ſending ſolemn thanks to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for their paſſing theſe Votes, and drawing down ſome of their Forces to gariſon <hi>Whitehall</hi> and the <hi>Mewes,</hi> it turned the Scale in the Houſe of Lords, and they alſo paſſed thoſe Votes.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:116047:26"/>
            <p>Soon after the paſſing of theſe votes of Non-addreſs, diſcontents grew high in all parts of the Kingdom; And the common people eſpecially in the parts about <hi>London,</hi> were wonderfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and even eaten up with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter. The Commiſſioners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> withdrew and went home, and with the aſſiſtance of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> formerly impriſoned by the King, and lately ſet free by the Parliament, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein they reſolve (<hi>Maugre</hi> the <hi>Kirk</hi>) to raiſe an Army for the delivery of the King.</p>
            <p>The beginning of this year 1648, was full of diſcontents. <label type="milestone">

            <p>Theſe Petitions being ſlighted, and many <hi>Surrey</hi> Gentlemen wounded by the Souldiers, at the Parliament door, and in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and ſome ſlain outright for preſenting their Petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kingdom grew into a general flame.

            <p>All this time the Parliament are conſulting about Propoſitions to be ſent to the King, as alſo of the place and manner of a perſonal treaty with him, which was deſired by the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> and moſt of the Kingdom to be had at <hi>London.</hi> Thus the time was ſpun on, and the Summer well-nigh ſpent, before they could agree upon termes for a perſonal treaty; and at length it was reſolved to be in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, while the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus deferre the Treaty, <hi>Cromwel</hi> is firſt ſent into <hi>Wales,</hi> to ſubdue them; where he found work enough for moſt part of the Summer: <hi>Fairfax</hi> is ſent

               <hi>Colcheſter</hi> after this, preſſed with a long ſiege, and pinched with hunger, at laſt yields to <hi>Fairfax</hi> upon very hard termes, <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame day that they entred the Town, they cauſed Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> and Sir <hi>George Liſle</hi> (too gallant men as ever <hi>England</hi> bred) to be ſhot to death in the Caſtle Yard: All the reſt of the Nobility and Gentlemen of quality, were carried away Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:116047:29"/>
            <p>The Treaty with the King is at length begun: a fixed number of days are at firſt appointed; that expired, a fortnight more is added, ſo that upon the finiſhing of the treaty, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all was concluded, <hi>Cromwel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with his victorious Army out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Army fearing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would agree with the King, and re-eſtabliſh him in his Throne (though the conditions were extream hard on his ſide) they firſt publiſh that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs vile Remonſtrance at <hi>Saint Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, Novemb.</hi> 16. 1648. wherein they declare their reſolutions to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the King for his life, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemy, or grand Delinquent, to bring him to trial. They prefix a time for the appearing of the <hi>Prince</hi> now beyond Sea, to anſwer for his crimes; and in caſe he refuſe to come in and ſubmit to a tryal, to baniſh his perſon as a Rebel and Traytor, and confiſcate his eſtate.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:116047:30"/>
            <p>This Remonſtrance was ſent to the Houſe of Commons, with a Letter ſigned by <hi>Fairfax</hi> the General, whom <hi>Cromwel</hi> abuſed and made his Stale in all this action) to take it ſpeedily into conſideration, as a matter admitting no delay: But the Commons laying it aſide, and making the more ſpeed to conclude with the King upon the Treaty, voting his conceſſions ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, ſo far as to be ground of peace; Suddenly on Tueſday, <hi>December.</hi> 5. A Party of the Army ſeize upon the Members of the Houſe, whom they conceive to be oppoſite to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; They impriſon many, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and deterre more, in all to the number of above two hundred, leaving about ſixty or ſeventy (if that) in the Houſe, and thoſe either Army men, or devoted vaſſals to <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his faction; theſe vote the Kings conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not ſatisfactory, and thereupon break off the Treaty.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:116047:30"/>
            <p>The Army then preſently ſeize upon the King in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Weight,</hi> they remove him in the night from <hi>Caresbrow Caſtle</hi> to <hi>Hurst Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> an unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom place, ſtanding two or three mile into the ſea, upon a very narrow neck of Land: there they cloſely impriſon him, and ſoon after obtain a Vote in their new modell'd Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to bring him to trial. The Lords refuſing to conſent, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without them, and draw up an impeachment againſt his Majeſty, by the advice of one <hi>Doriſley,</hi> an outlandiſh Doctor of Law, and that many years before, had been Hiſtory-Reader in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> preferred thither by the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> to read that Lecture by him firſt founded, but ſoon after ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced and put out by the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and Head of the Univerſity, for ſeditious Doctrine by him there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, againſt Monarchy.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:116047:31"/>
            <p>For the Kings Trial, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſeventy or eighty Perſons, the moſt of them Army-men (all of them his mortal enemies) to be his Judges: the Judges of the Land and moſt eminent Lawyers refuſing to joyn with them, or aſſiſt them, they appoint one <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> a poor petty-fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Lawyer, but of an audacious, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent forehead, to be Preſident of their high Court of Juſtice, ſo they call it, (more properly their Court of high injuſtice.) The King is brought from <hi>Hurſt Caſtle</hi> to <hi>Windſor,</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> where they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a Miniſter to keep the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val with him. From thence they bring him to <hi>White-Hall</hi> and Saint <hi>James</hi> about the tenth of <hi>January</hi> by water. And there afterwards, being brought four ſeveral times before their pretended Court of Juſtice, where he every time refuſing to anſwer, and diſclaiming their authority, offering to give his reaſons, but they refuſing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116047:31"/>to hear him, at laſt Saturday <hi>January</hi> 27. he is condemned to the block, and his head cut off on a Scaffold erected before his Palace gate at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> on Tueſday following, <hi>January</hi> 30. to the unexpreſſable grief and ſorrow of all true Engliſh People. And thus periſhed the beſt, the wiſeſt and the moſt Religious King that ever <hi>England</hi> had.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Lords that had baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complyed with the Commons, and ſupported them from the beginning hitherto againſt their King, becauſe they would not go along with them in this laſt moſt wicked act, are kickt off by a Vote. The very ſame day that they voted the abolition of Regal Government, <hi>February</hi> 7. 1648. they voted down the Houſe of Peers, as uſeleſs, inconvenient, and an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the proceedings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a juſt reward for ſo ignoble, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous ſpirits.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:116047:32"/>
            <p>And becauſe great Perſonages, like great Trees in a Forreſt, ſeldom fall alone, to compleat the Tragedie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few weeks after, they impeach Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> General of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Army, and the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> as alſo the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> taken in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and ſome others. None of theſe ſeared to be queſtioned for their lives till now, for they yielding, had quarter given them. But an high Court of Juſtice muſt not be ſet up for the King alone; They mean to go the ſame way to work with others: the Law taking no hold of them, they'l make a Law that ſhall; and therefore the like Court is erected again, for the trial of theſe Lords and others; though the ſame Preſident ſate not, yet others did, that had the ſame power.</p>
            <p>All that were accuſed, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but <hi>Goring</hi> being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of no great fortune, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore engaged againſt them, found
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116047:32"/>mercy at their hands; <hi>Capels</hi> great eſtate drove on his ruine. <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are obſerved to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered deſervedly, becauſe they had played on both parts, ſometimes for the King, and otherwhiles againſt him, as affairs changed: The poor ſpiritneſs of the reſt is obſerved, in cowardly ſubmitting to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended authority; only the ſtout Lord <hi>Capel</hi> (ſo <hi>Lilburn</hi> cals him) would not in the leaſt buckle to acknowledge them a lawful judicatory, but after the example of his Royal Maſter, denied their Anthority, and when he came to ſuffer (which he and the other did, <hi>March</hi> 9.) he took his death with a moſt reſolute and undaunted courage, not only to the admiration of all men, but even to the very terror of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; they that neither loved him nor his cauſe, yet highly commended him for his courage and magnanirnity, and as much deſpiſed <hi>Hamilton</hi> for his timerous baſeneſs, uſing all means
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116047:33"/>poſſible to ſave his life; but all would not do; much confidence he repoſed in <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> that Clergy Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, who at laſt betrayd him, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had formerly betrayed the King.</p>
            <p>After the King was thus put to death, and the Government changed into a Commonwealth, a new Seal and new Coyn being made, this Piece of the Parliament that put the King to death, governed the Nation till <hi>April</hi> 20. 1653. what time they were thrown out forcibly by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then their General) and his Army Officers, to the great content and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the People.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the King, the <hi>Scots</hi> proclaimed the Prince, King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Charls</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> having (as is ſaid before) proclaimed the Prince King; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him into that Kingdom and crowned him at <hi>Scone</hi> the firſt of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1649. 1650. whereupon the Parliament having reduced <hi>Ireland,</hi> they reſolve to ſend an Army into <hi>Scotland</hi> about <hi>June</hi> 1650. <hi>Fairfax</hi> upon this layes down his Commiſſion, and <hi>Cromw ll</hi> is made Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in his ſtead; He marches into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a great Army, where he lay a long time before he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the <hi>Scots</hi> to fight; inſomuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in great diſtreſs for proviſions, and had been famiſhed or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116047:34"/>forced to return long before, had they not encamped near the ſea, and had the ſea free and open to them. At length the <hi>Scots</hi> ſet upon them at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> but were defeated and routed; at leaſt 10000. of them ſlain and taken upon the place; all of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an party, and ſuch as had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in <hi>England</hi> for the Parliament againſt the King: An hundred Enſigns at leaſt are taken, brought up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and hung up in triumph in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Hall:</hi> and which is remarkable, great numbers of thoſe Souldiers, that at their coming into <hi>England</hi> in 1643. had heatheniſhly prophaned the Cathedral Church of <hi>Durham,</hi> were now brought priſoners, and lodged in the very ſame Church, ſhut' up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and fed like ſwine, with roots and other traſh, ſo that with hunger, and cold, and ſtench, lying there a long time, moſt of them periſhed; ſome of them acknowledging the juſt hand of God for their ſacrilegious propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116047:34"/>committed in that place: this is a certain truth, reported by credible perſons living near and in that City: And thus our Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> were in part payd for their brotherly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Cromwel</hi> hath not yet done with them; he ſtayes ſtill after the battel of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and purſues his victory: he preſently takes <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and afterward that ſtrong and impregnable Caſtle, called by the <hi>Scots</hi> the <hi>Maiden Caſtle,</hi> becauſe never before conquered: Nor can I ſay it was now conquered by <hi>Cromwell:</hi> He took it not by aſſault, nor yet by hunger, but as is credibly reported, ſurrendred by the treachery or cowardize of the Lord <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Parliament being thus turned out, <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Army Officers take upon them the government of the Nation: They preſently impoſe ſix Months Tax, and erect a new Council of State, (<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for his good ſervice was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is now not ſo much as a Member of the Council.) <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſoon after cals a Convention, of about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty perſons, pickt out by himſelf, out of the ſeveral Counties of the Nation, moſt of them inferiour

            <p>Thus being ſeated in Authority, they make an Act for ſix Months Tax, at the old rate of 120000 li. a Month; and another Act concerning marriages, appointing Juſtices of Peace to marry, and none other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages to be valid or lawful: In the

            <p>Things being carried ſo high and in ſuch a frantick manner, the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate among them weary of the work, and fearing they ſhould rather bring things into further confuſion, then ſettle any thing, they repair to <hi>Cromwel</hi> the General, deſiring him to take again into his hands his Writing or conveyance of the ſupream power; whereupon he preſently diſſolves them: but ſome of the Anabaptiſts refuſing to obey, and continuing ſtill in the houſe at their prayers, he ſent Souldiers who pulled them out, and lockt up the doors againſt them <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb.</hi> 12. 1653.</p>

            <p>It is probable the Protector fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that little or nothing would be done by this Parliament; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make ſure work, he and his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116047:40"/>Council, (beſides this Ordinance for his ſtile and Title, for the iſſuing out Writs, and for Law-proceedings, to go according to that Stile and Title, and ſome others of the like nature, made in the beginning of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately upon the Change) I ſay beſides theſe, before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of this Parliament a very few dayes, he publiſhes by Authority of himſelf and his Council above twenty Ordinances (as ſome reckoned them,) which were obſerved as valid Laws; and amongſt them, one remarkable one, for the Ejecting of Ignorant, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and inſufficient Miniſters, by any five, or more of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners therein named: and by which in a quarter of a years time, they ejected many Miniſters (eſpecially in <hi>Norfolk</hi>) out of their livings; ſcarce one of twenty that were accuſed or complained of, but were ejected; And this was done (I ſuppoſe) to gratifie the Anabaptiſtical and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116047:40"/>party, who hitherto beheld <hi>Oliver</hi> with an evil eye, ſince he was Protector, looking (as they thought) too like a King.</p>
            <p>The Parliament convened accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment at <hi>Weſtminſter, Septemb.</hi> 3. they preſently queſtion the Protectors Authority, though he had at their firſt meeting, in a very large ſpeech, preſently after printed and publiſhed, magnified the ſame, as if he had been called to the Place, by the concurrent and univerſal conſent of the whole Nation. It is true they conſented, becauſe they could do no otherwiſe, being forced thereunto by his armed power.</p>
            <p>to ſilence and ſuppreſs this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, within a few dayes after their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he enjoyns a Recognition or acknowledgement of his power, by a particular ſubſcription of every one of the Members, before they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter the Houſe any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch as would not ſubſcribe, were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116047:41"/>forcibly ſecluded by a guard of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but at laſt all or moſt of them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were they ſet again, but they fall in hand with the Inſtrument of Government, examining it in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular; and the Protector ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to go on without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. They would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have made him Protector, but they would not allow of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government in all things.</p>
            <p>Ye muſt know by the way, that one Article of the Government was, that the Parliament called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, muſt ſit five months (if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves think good) and during that time, the Protector had not power to diſſolve them; but afterwards at any time he might: It was further ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that whatſoever Acts they made and tendred to him, if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent within thirty dayes, or ſatisfie them to the contrary, they were to be Laws valid and binding, without
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116047:41"/>him. To conclude, they ſpent ſo long time in tuning the inſtrument, that juſt at the five moneths end (counting preciſely twenty eight dayes to a moneth) the Protector calls them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, tells them he thought they had been aſleep, having not of a long time heard from them; That they had ſate long and done nothing, and therefore tells them they may repaire every one to his ſeveral home. Thus they are diſſolved with a kind of jeer, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 22.1654.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell you, the Parliament, would not tender him any Bill to paſſe, nor receive any Laws from him, till ſuch time as they had regulated the Government of the Nation, and confirmed his authority upon him. The truth is, they thought him not to have power to enact Laws, till themſelves had given it him: And therefore they would have nothing paſs, till alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were done and finiſhed.</p>
            <p>After the breaking up of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116047:42"/>it was generally thought, we ſhould never have had any more in his time. For the Protector betakes himſelf to other Methods of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That year 1655. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1655</label> he inſtitutes his Major General: He divides the whole Kingdom into ſeven Provinces or Cantons; (three, four or five (more or fewer) Counties in a Province.) And over every of theſe, he placeth a Major, General with his Deputy, and ſufficient Authority, not only in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affairs, but alſo in Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; none came amiſs to them, they would meddle in all, upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on complaint: Eſpecially in Church-affairs, they take upon them the ſoveraign power; they put out; ſilence and inhibit what Miniſters they pleaſe, by vertue of the late Ordinance againſt ſcandalous Miniſters, and other orders &amp; private inſtructions, to them, from the Protector &amp; his Council. They
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116047:42"/>will not ſuffer any ejected Miniſter to teach a School either publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; to pray, or preach, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Miniſterial duty in any Church or private Family; in a word, they would have ſtarved them, if they could, denying all means of livelyhood to them and theirs.</p>
            <p>And becauſe divers ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, had during the ſitting of this laſt Parliament, and ſoon after, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced ſuits in Law for the recovery of their Livings, and had gotten (ſome of them) damages againſt their Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and had hopes of recovering the poſſeſſion of their Livings: and ſome of them had already got into poſſeſſion by Law: The Protector publiſheth a Proclamation, thereby ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to quit their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to releaſe all judgements ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and further inhibiting all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournies, Lawyers and Advocates, to commence or proſecute any Suits for, or to plead in the behalf of ſuch
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116047:43"/>Clients; And all Judges are likewiſe inhibited, to admit of any ſuch Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Pleas in any of their Courts. All which, was apparently to deny them the benefit of the Law, (which is the higheſt Act of Arbitrary and Tyranni-power that can be) and conſequently to condemn that Authority as illegal, by which they were firſt ejected.</p>
            <p>Furthermore upon occaſion of a riſing in the Spring, by ſome of the Kings party in the Weſt, he not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds againſt Col. <hi>Iohn Penruddock,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen, by Capital puniſhment; but he decimates all the Cavaleers or Gentlemen of the late Kings party, that had been in arms for him, all over <hi>England;</hi> that is, he enjoyns them to pay yearly the tenth part of their whole Revenue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their former Compoſitions made for their Eſtates, and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſued out as the Parliament had enjoyned, and alſo the late Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, <hi>anno</hi> 1651. And this Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116047:43"/>was put in execution by theſe Major Generals.</p>
            <p>And in this Government, he much reſembled the <hi>Turk:</hi> Himſelf like the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> ruling by ſole command, had his ſtanding Army (as a guard for his Perſon) anſwerable to the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries and his Major Generals repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the</hi> Baſhaws in their ſeveral Provinces; And beſides theſe, he had his Auxiliaries lately ſet up in every County; <hi>viz.</hi> certain Troops of horſe, and Companies of foot, armed and ready upon all occaſions, maintaining, and finding their own horſes and arms; for a conſtant yearly ſalary, the horſemen had 8 <hi>li. per annum,</hi> and the foot 3 <hi>li.</hi> and theſe were upon any occaſion to be drawn forth, and march in a few hours warning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. The Protector cals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Parliament, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1656</label> according to the lade mode, ten in a County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe convene at <hi>Weſtminſter, Sept.</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:116047:44"/>17. Upon their firſt meeting, many of the Members of ſeveral Counties were excluded, becauſe they had been ſomewhat buſie and active in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament before. This excluſion of Members being noiſed abroad, many that were not yet gone up, went not at all, leſt when they came there, they ſhould be excluded and ſent home again. There were in all about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſcore or more that abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or were ſecluded the Houſe by order from the Council of State; and yet not any reaſon alledged againſt them. They repreſent the injury to the Houſe, but find no redreſs; the Houſe dare not offend the Protector, by admitting their Fellow-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>This Parliament thus purged and garbled, was for the Protectors turn; he gave them leave to ſit almoſt two five moneths without diſſolving or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:116047:44"/>
            <p>About the begining of the next ſpring, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1657</label> there is a project ſet on foot by ſome in the Houſe for making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector King: Firſt a petition or remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance from many of the City deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was preſented by an Alderman of <hi>London</hi> to the Speaker, ſealed up in a box. Afterwards a Bill is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it: the Houſe are very forward in the buſineſs; only the Protectors pleaſure is not known. They very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſolemnly petition his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept of it; as an honor not only merited by himſelf, but much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the ſettlement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But he makes ſtrange at it, gives them thanks for their good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards him and the publick; yet deſires time to conſider of it, before they preſs him to a reſolution.</p>
            <p>Mean time the <hi>Independents</hi> and Factious people faſt and pray, to avert the judgment that is like to fall upon them, in having a King. Some great Commanders in the Army, and many
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116047:45"/>of the common-ſouldiers expreſs their diſlike of it; amongſt whom <hi>Lambert,</hi> the Leiutenant-General, is the cheif, conceiving it a barre to his ambitious hopes. It is more then probable, the Protector himſelf thirſted after it, and that the deſigne was firſt hammered in his own forge; for <hi>Thurloe</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary openly promoted it, and (as it was ſaid) brought in the Bill. But when the Parliament made their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond addreſs to him, he modeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, yet he gave them thanks for their good affections to him.</p>
            <p>This Parliament ſat from the 17. of <hi>September,</hi> to the 26. of <hi>June.</hi> And then by an Act entituled <hi>The humble Petition and advice,</hi> they conſtitute him Protector, and give him power to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his Succeſſor, which was all one as to eſtabliſh the Government in his Family: They erect another Houſe of Parliament, in place of the Lords, for which they could invent no other name, but <hi>The Other Houſe.</hi> It was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116047:45"/>to conſiſt of a number of perſons not exceeding ſeventy, nor leſs then four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all choſen or nominated by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and to be called particularly by Writs, as the Houſe of Peers were wont to be: They alſo ordain ſome other qualifications for future elections of Parliament men; and appoint an Oath to be taken by the Protector, and by all ſucceſſive Protectors: and alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Oath by all the Members, both of the one and Other Houſe upon their enterance to ſit in Parliament. Some other things they ordaine in that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and advice, for ſetling the future Government. All which the Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ratifies and confirms, by giving his ſolemn aſſent in thoſe words, <hi>the Lord Protector doth conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further in that Act, they limit him ſo far, as not to impoſe any Tax or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the People, without their conſent in Parliament; and in lieu thereof, they give him 35000 li. a month by way of Tax for three years
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116047:46"/>to come, from <hi>June</hi> 24. 1657. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Exciſe, Tunage and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the Cuſtoms, all the Crown lands that were unfold, and all Forfeitures, Penalties, and other accidental Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were wont to have; amounting in the whole to Thirteen Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> for ſo much they promiſed to ſettle upon him forthwith, as a certaine ſtanding Revenue, beſides land Taxes. This done, he does not diſſove, but only adjourn the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the 20. of <hi>January</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time ſoon after their adjournment, the Protector Caſhiers <hi>Lambert</hi> his Lieutenant-General, and <hi>Hacker</hi> Colonel of his life-guard, and ſome other Officers of his Army, who were conceived to be averſe to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his Kingſhip; which gave men cauſe to conclude, that he ſtill thirſted after the Kingly dignity, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is more then probable he did.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:116047:46"/>
            <p>And here let me tell you, there go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſtory very credibly and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported by ſome perſons knowing and well-affected to the late Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, That he, when he was a boy, and going to ſchoole at <hi>Huntington,</hi> where his father dwelt, dreamed one night thar he ſhould be King, and Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> but afterward he ſhould be hanged. This dream he tells to his fellow ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, and by that meanes it came to his Maſters eare, who laſhed him ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it. How near the former part of his dream was fulfilled, appears by this ſtory; and how juſtly he deſerved the latter part, I leave it to others to judge?</p>
            <p>Againſt the meeting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by adjournment, he ſends out his Writ, for ſummoning the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his other Houſe. Some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Peers of the Land he ſummoned, as the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Say;</hi> I cannot
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116047:47"/>ſay, whether or no the Earl of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was one, becauſe he ſeldom want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a place in the Houſe of Commons. Others, ſome of them, were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of quality in ſeveral Counties, and of good repute, but the moſt of them were of his Army-men, or of his alliance, that had married into his Family. Amongſt his Army-men, there were <hi>Pride</hi> the Dray-man, <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the Shoomaker, <hi>Barkſted</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Thimble-maker, and others the like, all Colonels of his Army; and <hi>Lambert</hi> alſo to gratifie him, is made one of his Peers; and <hi>Haſelrig,</hi> that was a great ſtickler againſt him in all Parliaments, is another. There is a Catalogue extant of them all, and therefore it is needleſs to repeat them.</p>
            <p>When the time came according to the Adjournment, <hi>January</hi> 20. the Nobility though called, diſdained to appear: Many of the Gentry abſented themſelves, yet ſome of all ſorts (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only the Nobility) enough to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116047:47"/>make a competent number, appeared. Some that were called to his other Houſe, were elected for the Houſe of Commons, and choſe that place, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the other Houſe; Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelrig</hi> (always an enemy to the King, and no friend to the Protector) was one of the number: The Houſe of Commons would by no means digeſt that other Houſe, nor own them; though ſome meſſages were ſent to them, yet would they not vouchſafe them any anſwer.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, there was another bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſet on foot in the Houſe of Commons, that touched the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector very nearly; and that was their tampering with the power of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia:</hi> The People were to pay the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and it was thought juſt by many, that the Parliament ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them. And it was ſuſpected, had they ſate but a little longer, that the Army, or a conſiderable part of it, would have adhered to the Parliament.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116047:48"/>To prevent this miſchief, that was a working, the Protector ſuddenly and unexpectedly diſſolves them, <hi>Febr.</hi> 4. with this word of comfort (neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) to his other Houſe, My Lords, ye are Lords, and ſhall be Lords.</p>
            <p>The Parliament thus again diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in diſcontent, things reſted as formerly, though not without much murmuring and ſecret diſcontent, both in the Protector and People.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1658</label> or the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector dyed; having lain ſomewhile in a very ſad condition, with extream pain and torment in his bowels. Some ſtrongly fancy, that he died on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. what time was the moſt furious, violent wind, that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the memory of man. And its very probable that he died that day or ſoon after: but it was given out, and commonly reported, that he dyed on Friday, <hi>Sept.</hi> 3.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:116047:48"/>
            <p>His Funeral was a great while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, his body embalmed and kept above ground many moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with mourners continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his corpſe, and meat carried up and ſerved on his Table, as if he had been the greateſt Prince in Chriſtendom, and afterwards he was interred with as great funeral ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as ever any King of <hi>England</hi> was interred, and his Hearſe or Statue ſet up after the manner of Kings, and a moſt moſt magnificent Monument erected for him.</p>
            <p>It is worth the remembring, that about a year or two before his death, he made a new broad Seal, with the Arms of <hi>England, viz.</hi> a Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Croſs, quartered with Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> Croſs for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Harp for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his own Coat in a little Eſcutcheon in the midſt; his Helmet and Mantle, with a Crown imperial, and a Lion puiſſant for his Creſt, and and the ſupporters a Lyon and a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116047:49"/>the Motto underneath his Arms, <hi>Pax quaeritur Bello.</hi> And this inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about, <hi>Sigillum magnum Reipublicae Anglioe, Scotiae &amp; Hiberniae:</hi> On the other ſide, himſelf on Horſeback, richly trappered, as the King Seal was wont to be; and the Inſcription about it, <hi>Oliverus Dei gratia, Reipublicae An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae, Scotiae &amp; Hiberniae Protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though he uſually coined no money, yet I have ſeen ſome pieces of Silver, of an half crown bigneſs, with his Arms (as before) on the one ſide, and his Picture crowned with bays on the other ſide, and the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. In theſe reſpects ſo near he approached to the Royal dignity; ſure I am, he aſſumed more power and authority, then ever any King of <hi>England</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The Protector before his death, had according to the fore-mentioned Humble Petition and Advice, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his eldeſt Son <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> to ſucceed him in his place; and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116047:49"/>accordingly immediately after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, he was proclaimed in <hi>London,</hi> and ſoon after all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Independents, Anabaptiſts and other Sectaries, were not well pleaſed at it; they had rather have had <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in the place, who had married the late Protectors Daughter, <hi>Iretons</hi> Widow; for <hi>Richard</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been reputed a kind of a good fellow and a Royalliſt, and never was in Arms againſt the King, as all the reſt of his Fathers Family and Allies had been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> ſoon after cals a Parliament to begin at <hi>Weſtminſter, Jan.</hi> 27. not according to the Inſtrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but after the old way, two in a County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before the calling of the Parliament, and after, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory Addreſſes are made to <hi>Richard,</hi> from moſt Counties, Cities and Corporations of Note in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> extolling the merits of his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Father, expreſſing their joy for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116047:50"/>the ſucceſſion of ſuch a Son, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to adhere to him withall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and loyalty. In ſome of their Addreſſes, they compare the Father to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Son to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Guiders and Conductors of Gods People out of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> thraldom, with other the like blaſphemous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. <hi>Richard</hi> receives theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes with as much gravity, as they were tendered with humility; ſo that no man could imagine, but that he was moſt firmly fixed in his Throne; And <hi>Lilly</hi> the States mercenary Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticator, aſſures it, from his Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Predictions of that year.</p>
            <p>AT the opening of the Parliament, <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. he makes a Speech to both his Houſes, wherein he minds them of his juſt and lawful Title to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, not only by the wonderful Provindence of God, but by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Laws: he tels them, he had convened them together for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs of State, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116047:50"/>and ſafety of the Nation; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to take into conſideration, the neceſſity of the Navy and Army, whom he commends for their patience and obedience, to the beſt Army in the world: ſome other things to this purpoſe he commended to them, and told them in concluſion, that they ſhould find him ready and willing to concur with them in any thing for the good of the publick; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them nothing that was juſt and fit; And that if this were not an happy Parliament, it ſhould not be his fault. And all this (ſays the Book) was ſpoken with ſo gracious and Princely a deportment, as hath gained this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongſt the wiſeſt Hearers, that he deſervedly holds the place of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magiſtrate in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Thus the Parliament began, and great hopes there were of good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Protector and the People: and doubtleſs he for his part,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116047:51"/>would have given them leave to have ſetled the Nation as they thought good, both for Religion and Civil Government. But ſtill the other Houſe, though called as formerly, and many of them convened, would not down with the Commons; they would not in the leaſt own this new made Houſe of Lords; ſit they might, if they pleaſed, but little or nothing they had to do: for the Commons would never impart any thing to them, nor indeed have any intercourſe with them. A pitiful company of Peers they were, and accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Richard</hi> and the Houſe of Commons agreed very well; he was willing to leave all to them; And there being a very great number of young Lawyers in the Houſe, that gaped for preferment, they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give him power enough: too much as many ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Ye muſt know, that in all Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116047:51"/>ſince <hi>Olivers</hi> time, there was a faction of men in the Houſe, called Common-wealths men, that were for a free State (as they called it) and againſt a ſingle Perſon. Theſe were ſuch as had purchaſed the Lands of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deans and Chapters, and thoſe belonging to the late King, Queen, and Prince; And they feared, that theſe Lands might be at one time or other reſtored, unleſs the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were again ſetled in the way of a Common-wealth: for a ſingle Perſon they thought might poſſibly come to be a King. With theſe alſo concurred all ſuch, both Parliament-men and Army<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as were highly guilty of the Kings Trial and death. And all theſe together, had a great influence upon the Army. Theſe generally were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the Protector.</p>
            <p>The Army alſo (<hi>Richard</hi> having never been a Souldier) were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have a General of their own choice with power to place and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116047:52"/>what Army-Officers he thought fit. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> the Protectors Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in-law, or <hi>Lambert</hi> aims at the place; To effect their deſign, they with the Commonwealths men in Parliament, as <hi>Haſelrig,</hi> and <hi>Vane, Scot</hi> and <hi>Weaver,</hi> and others the like, make a Faction in the Army againſt the Protector. The Commanders of the Army that were of this Faction, had frequent meetings at <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Lodging at <hi>Wallingford</hi> Houſe; whereof <hi>Richard</hi> had notice, and might have ſuppreſt them in time, by ſome chief Officers that were of his part, who offered their aſſiſtance thereunto; but being loth to hazard the effuſion of blood, he let things reſt, hoping (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) they would not have proceeded as afterwards they did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ſoon after adviſes him to adjourn the Parliament, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1659</label> but he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they come to him, and force him to ſend a Writ to diſſolve it; This
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116047:52"/>was about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> 1659.</p>
            <p>The Parliament thus ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the Souldiers were at a loſs what to do; at laſt they reſolve, after a ſolemn Faſt had among themſelves (as their manner was) to call in that piece or tail of the long Parliament, (that <hi>Cromwell</hi> and themſelves had broke up and caſt out ſix years before, <hi>April</hi> 20. 1653.) to return again to the exerciſe of their truſt, as they termed it; expreſſing their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for that action, and deſiring to return again into the good old way. <hi>Lenthal</hi> the Speaker, and ſome others of that company, being then in and about the City, very gladly accept the motion; they thought long to be again in authority. They call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all their fellow-Members that they could get, and had much ado to make fourty, thought they took two of them out of the Gaol, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Munſon</hi> and <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> who
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116047:53"/>were Priſoners there upon execution: Being thus got together upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day afternoon, <hi>May</hi> 7. the Speaker with the reſt, enter the Houſe, and ſet again as a Parliament; publiſhing a Proclamation or Declaration, to let the People underſtand, how by the wonderful providence and mercy of God, they were again reſtored to the exerciſe of their truſt, being (as they call themſelves) Aſſerters of the Good old Cauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Munday following, Mr. <hi>William Prin</hi> a Bencher of <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inn, and many more Members of the Long Parliament, that were ſecluded upon the Kings Tryal, <hi>December</hi> 1648. met together at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and went to the Houſe-door, demanding admiſſion to ſit with the reſt, but were den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed entrance, and kept out with armed guards. Whereupon he writes a Book called his Narrative, wherein he declraes at large their manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding admiſſion, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116047:53"/>they were forcibly kept out, and very ſolidly pleads the Kings cauſe againſt their Commonwealth. And another Book he writes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes at the ſame time, intituled, The good old Cauſe, wherein he manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, by twelve undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that that which they termed the good old Cauſe, was far worſe, more deſtructive both to Church and State, to Religion and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then the Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And though he openly owned and avowed theſe Books, ſetting his name to them, yet they never returned the leaſt anſwer to them, nor queſtioned the Author: But theſe Books thus ſeaſonably pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, gave a deadly blow to their good old Cauſe, though the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it was not ſo preſently diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>The Parliament (thoſe few that were) being thus got in again, they preſently depoſe the Protector, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116047:54"/>alter the Government from a ſingle perſon to a Common-wealth. They null all honouts conferred by the late Protector, ſo that many are in an inſtant unknighted, whom <hi>Oliver</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had honoured with that dignity. <hi>Richard</hi> himſelf but the other day Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his Highneſs at every word, is now in the language of the Parliament but <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> Eſq; for by that Title they wrote to him, to quit his Lodgings, and remove from <hi>White-hall:</hi> and his Excellency Lord <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is now no more then Mr. <hi>Henry Cromwel;</hi> All <hi>Olivers</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Houſe of Peers, have now in an inſtant loſt their Lordſhips, and are the ſame that formerly they were; ſo great a change is effected in an inſtant. Only <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> are ſtill termed Lords in the Parliaments firſt Declaration, <hi>May</hi> 7. and there was cauſe for it; for the Parliament were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116047:54"/>what they were by their means.</p>
            <p>And now all mouths are open in an inſtant, againſt the late Protector <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> reproaching him as the worſt of Tyrants and Uſurpers, tearing his Hearſe or Statue in pieces, defacing and pulling down his ſumptuous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, that was but a few weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at a moſt vaſt charge, ſet up in <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament were more obliged to the Army, then they were to the people, for putting them again into Authority; for the people had had more then enough of them, for almoſt two ſeven years before. <hi>Oliver</hi> never did ſo much good for the Nation, nor had more thanks from the people, then when he and his Army had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe men out, as before is ſaid, <hi>April</hi> 20. 1653. And therefore they thought it concerned them, rather to gratifie the Army, then to pleaſe the people. To this end, not long after their re-inſtallment, they impoſe a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116047:55"/>Tax of twelve months, to be paid in a manner altogether. That 35000 li. a month which was not to be paid by the Act that impoſed it, till <hi>Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> 1660. and that quarterly, they command to be paid in preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Lammas</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1659. intending (as its probable) as ſoon as that was paid in, to impoſe another the like payment upon the people.</p>
            <p>After this, about <hi>July,</hi> they paſs an Act for ſetling the <hi>Militia,</hi> and it was ſent down into the ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be preſently put in execution; but the Army (as it was thought) not reliſhing this deſign, it was ſoon after laid aſide.</p>
            <p>This year about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there was a riſing in <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and the parts adjoyning, under the command of Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Midleton,</hi> and other Gentlemen in thoſe parts; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for a free and full Parliament to be elected by the People. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116047:55"/>reported, the deſign was general, laid all over all <hi>England,</hi> and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Party. But <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and the parts adjacent, were the firſt that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe; in other places attempts were made, but they were ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had taken <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> both Town and Caſtle, and was reported to be very numerous. And therefore upon the firſt intelligence thereof, <hi>Lambert</hi> is ſent out againſt him, with an Army of ſix or ſeven thouſand men, and a train of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and forces from all quarters are appointed to draw to him, ſo that all meeting, he had a very great Army. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s party, ſeeing other Counties ſo ſlack, begin to faint and forſake him; <hi>Lambert</hi> marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, is oppoſed by ſome forces at a narrow paſs, but preſently all are routed, and Sir <hi>George</hi> himſelf, and ſome others are taken and brought priſoners to <hi>London:</hi> this hapned about <hi>Aug.</hi> 20.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:116047:56"/>
            <p>This deſign ſo ſtrongly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally (as was reported) laid, and ſo ſoon defeated and diſappointed, the Parliament themſelves, and all men thought them cock-ſure. They begun to reſolve to ſubmit themſelves to the yoke of their old Task-maſters, ſeeing no other remedy; And the Parliament went on with their work, in ſetling the Nation in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth way; intending after that was eſtabliſhed, to proceed ſeverely againſt Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and his party. They began already to ſequeſter his and other mens eſtates; for many they ſay were engaged in the plot, all over <hi>England:</hi> and the City of <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> they quite diſ-franchiſed.</p>
            <p>But obſerve what followed. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and the Army were ſo heightened at this ſucceſs, and the Parliament (as they thought) ſo much obliged to them, for reſtoring them into their power, and preſerving them in it, as they thought whatſoever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116047:56"/>would not have been denied them. Thereupon in their return to <hi>London,</hi> they take a reſolution by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of the Officers and common Souldiers to require to have a General of their own Election, either <hi>Fleetwood</hi> or <hi>Lambert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament having intelligence hereof, reſolve the contrary; calling to mind, how ſix years before they had been ſerved by <hi>Oliver,</hi> who then was their General: and therefore they thought it not fit any more to intruſt ſo great a power in any one mans hand, leaſt he ſhould do as <hi>Oliver</hi> had done. And therefore they reſolve and vote, to put the power of the Army into the hands of ſeven Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereof about two or three (at moſt) were Army-men, and the reſt Members of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This Vote of theirs highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented the Army, and <hi>Lambert</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially; the buſineſs came to than height, as about the tenth or eleventh
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116047:57"/>of <hi>October,</hi> their forces were drawn out on either ſide at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Some Regiments for the Parliament under the command of <hi>Haſelrig, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and others; and other Regiments for the Army, under command of <hi>Lambert, Deſborough, Berry</hi> and other Colonels, and ready they were to charge one another. The Council of State interpoſing, prevented blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but could not appeaſe or ſatisfie the Army. At length the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters, and turned out the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>October</hi> 13. whom but a few months before, they had placed in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament did prudently and ſtoutly in one thing; when they ſaw whereto they muſt, that the Army would turn them out, a day or two before (<hi>Octob.</hi> 11.) they made an <hi>Act</hi> preſently after printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, That it ſhould be high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in any, to impoſe, aſſeſs, collect, levy, or pay any Exciſe, Cuſtoms,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116047:57"/>Tunnage and Poundage, or any Taxe or Tallage whatſoever, from that 11th day of <hi>October,</hi> but what ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the conſent of the People themſelves in Parliament.</p>
            <p>This was a ſtumbling-block to the Army-men; it hindred them ſomewhat from the raiſing of money for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but had things ſucceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their minde, they would ſoone have leapt over it, and raiſed what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Parliament thus caſheerd by the Army, the next thing they do is to provide places for themſelves. <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> is made General, <hi>Lambert</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General, <hi>Desborough</hi> is made General of the horſe. And they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a place for <hi>Monck</hi> alſo, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is Governour of <hi>Scotland;</hi> him they will make Major General of the foot. This for the Army.</p>
            <p>For the government of the State they muſt take time to conſider of that. But ſome things they lay for grounds
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116047:58"/>and principles. 1: They'l free the people of the burthen of Tythes (and in time perhaps of Miniſters too) that hath been a deſigne all along ſince the Army gave Law to the Nation. 2. They will perhaps have a kinde of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not of the choyce of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the people (ſay they) are grown generally ſo corrupt, as they are not fit to chooſe their own repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; but muſt be left to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In ſtead of an Houſe of Lords, thev'l have a ſtanding Senate of Army-Officers and ſuch like godly men, which ſhall have a Negative voice in all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary conſultations. Theſe and ſome others, as I concluded out of ſome of their books, were their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, though much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation they had, and ſome progreſſe they made in framing a Government, yet could they make no work of it, they could not agree of any. Only thus, for the preſent exigence of affairs, they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116047:58"/>eſtabliſh a Committee of Safety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting moſtly of Army Officers, and ſome Members of the late Parliament, that ſince the diſſolution thereof, had ſided with the Army, whereof Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane</hi> was one.</p>
            <p>But that which ſpoyled the ſport, and gave check-mate to their new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Government, was a buſineſſe in <hi>Scotland. Monck</hi> (as I touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was governour of that Nation, and had been ſo in all theſe changes, almoſt ever ſince <hi>Oliver</hi> took upon him the Protectors place. They had provided <hi>Monck</hi> a place among them, (ſo courteous they were) but they were not ſo prudent as to conſult with him about breaking up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And therefore upon the firſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of theſe things, <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> declares againſt their proceedings. The ſouldiers here (without expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating) preſently arme againſt him; inſomuch as their forces are upon their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116047:59"/>march towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> and the parts thereabout, upon the 29th of <hi>October</hi> the Parliament having been broken up but bare ſixteen days before; <hi>Monck</hi> ſeeing them thus on the forehand with him, entertains them with a Treaty; Commiſſioners are appointed on both ſides, and furniſhed with inſtructions; mean time <hi>Monck</hi> takes and fortifies <hi>Barwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed.</hi> The newes comes that they are agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that both parties have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly declared againſt the intereſt of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> (ſo they commonly call the King) which cauſed much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing amongſt the Armies adherents; but this ſoone after proved to be falſe: <hi>Monck</hi> at the return of his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, is not ſatisfied in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; Nevertheleſſe ſoone after, he deſires another Treaty, which was held at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> during which time he calls a Covention of the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who (as it was reported) not only approved this his undertaking, but aſſiſted him in it.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:116047:59"/>
            <p>The Treaty at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> after ſome time ſpent therein, had no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe than the former; They could not, or at leaſtwiſe <hi>Monck</hi> would not agree. But <hi>Fleetwood</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gives intelligence to his adherents in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that they were ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that if they ſhould grant what <hi>Monck</hi> inſiſted upon, it would be no whit prejudicial to them.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were thus act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it pleaſed God there hapned a great froſt, and after that ſo deep a ſnow, as the like hath not been known of many years, both for the greatneſſe and continuance of it. <hi>Monck</hi> was all that time with his Army at <hi>Barwick</hi> and thereabouts, never advancing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>England</hi> than <hi>Alnwick. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and his Army having much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and thoſe parts, what with Texas and Free-quarter, were now about <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> quarterred in a barren cold Countrey, and not able to march by reaſon of the hardneſſe of the waether.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:116047:60"/>
            <p>In the meane time I muſt tell you, from <hi>Lambers</hi> firſt advancing againſt <hi>Monck,</hi> the <hi>Londoners</hi> had been ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and the reſt, to joyn with the Army; but they utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, though they liked well enough the turning out of the Parliament. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> the Apprentices and ſome others Petition the Lord Major and Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; the ſouldiers interpoſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there is a great hurliburly in the City, and ſome blood is ſhed, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (they ſay) being ſlaine; but by the means fo the Major, the tumult is appeaſed. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to curb the City, and prevent any riſings hereafter, ſends in a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of his Army; they take and fortifie four houſes in ſeveral parts of the City, whereof <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge was one; theſe they ſtrengthen with ſouldiers and Granadoes, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to fire the City in caſe the Citizens ſhould ſtir.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:116047:60"/>
            <p>VVhile theſe things were thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>London, Haſelrig</hi> and ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Officers, that from the firſt had adhered to the Parliament, got into <hi>Portſmouth</hi> about <hi>December</hi> the third; and there joyning with ſome chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Navy, declare openly for the Parliament againſt the Army; And becauſe the City of <hi>London</hi> would not joyne with them, (for they liked the Parliament as thus conſtituted, as ill as they did the Army) they will a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Navy under the command of <hi>Lawſon</hi> then Admiral, (who had a little before deſerted the Army) block up the <hi>Thames;</hi> this was about a week before Chriſtimas.</p>
            <p>The City thus blockt up by Sea, and Gariſon'd with <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by Land, were in a ſad condition: but for all this they would neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the Army nor Parliament, but ſtill deſired to have a free Parliament of the election of the People; to which the ſouldiers forced by neceſſity and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116047:61"/>want of money, at laſt conſented; but with ſuch qualifications, as had they been obſerved, would have rendered the Parliament wholly ſubſervient to the Armies intereſt; And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety had by a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſummoned the ſame to begin at <hi>Weſtminſter, Ianuary</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>But the Parliament now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>Rump,</hi> (and ſo I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after terme them) taking the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of this difference between the Citie and Army, made a ſhift to meet together, (a competeur number of them (about 40.) and to crowde again into the Houſe, <hi>December</hi> 26. late in the Evening by Torch-light. But leſt the <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhould joyne with the Army, and oppoſe, they promiſe upon their firſt fitting, either to call in the Secluded Members by the 6th. of <hi>Jannuary;</hi> or elſe to iſſue out Writs for filling up the Houſe by new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. To pacifie the Army, they paſſe a Vote of Indempnity to <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,

            <p>But I muſt tell you, that before this, they had endeavoured what they might, in all the Counties, to raiſe money for the ſupply of the Army, but could not get any confiderable ſums. The Gentlemen in the Countrey, that had been laid horſes by vertue of the late Act for the Militia (which was firſt ſet on foot by the Parliament of <hi>July</hi> laſt, but laid aſide ſoone after for fear of offending the Army) theſe they now rate at 10 l. for every horſe; yet rather than faile they would have taken fifty ſhillings. Some that were faint-hearted compounded at ſo low a rate, and paid; but many refuſed. And of them that compounded, the moſt part would never pay a penny. This was about the beginning of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:116047:62"/>and ſome money by this tric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they got, but not much. About the ſame time alſo, they ſent forth warrants for one moneths Tax, aſſeſſed for Drums and Colours, &amp;c. by vertue of the ſaid Act, but this in many places was never paid, and in moſt places though rated, yet not paid. So that the want of money, was the maine thing that broke their deſigne; the ſouldiers about <hi>London,</hi> mutining and growing inſolent againſt their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders for want of pay: ſome of them falling to that party that adhered to the Parliament, and others offering their ſervice and aſſiſtance to the City, whom they thought beſt able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them; ſo that it came to that paſſe before the <hi>Rump</hi> got in, that <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> had little or no command of his ſouldiers in and about the City. And this gave another advantage to the <hi>Rump</hi> to croud in.</p>
            <p>Being got in as before is noted, The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are yet jealous,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116047:62"/>that they would not according to their promiſe, call in the ſecluded Members, nor fill up their Houſe by new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore they fortifie the City in ſeveral ſtreets and places of acceſſe with chains and poſts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſudden incurſion of horſes; For now they feared the <hi>Rump</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much or more than formerly they did the Army: this was about the beginning of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed within a few dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they diſcovered their intentions; the <hi>Rump</hi> was ſo far from calling in the ſecluded Members, as they paſſed a Vote that never any of them ſhould ſit again: and in ſtead of filling up their Houſe by a new election, they are about contriving an Oath of abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby to force men under a penalty to abjure the King and all the Royal Line or Family; but this Oath ſtuck long in debate, and at laſt would not paſſe amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the <hi>Rump</hi> was
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116047:63"/>thus got into poſſeſſion, and likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold it, <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the news of it quite broken and diſperſed, himſelf ſecretly departing from them at <hi>Rippon,</hi> and poſting to <hi>London</hi> to accept his Vote of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Monck</hi> advanceth with his Army, marching on ſlowly, and was come to <hi>Newcastle</hi> about the ſixth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> without the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> likes well of it, hoping by his aſſiſtance to quell the City, who as yet ſtood at diſtance with them, and had in a ſort fortified themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The <hi>Londoners</hi> on the contrary, entertaine hopes, that by <hi>Moncks</hi> coming, the Parliament might be enforced, notwithſtanding their former Vote, either to call in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Members, or elſe to ſill up the Houſe with new elections, either of which would have ſatisfied them, and one of which they reſolved to inſiſt upon. All expectations on either ſide, are upon <hi>Monck,</hi> but no man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116047:63"/>knew certainly what his intentions were.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> had from the firſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of <hi>Moncks</hi> advancing, after <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army was disbanded and broken, ſent two of their Members (<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi>) to wait upon him, or rather indeed as Spies to watch and obſerve him. The City of <hi>London</hi> had alſo ſent their Sword-bearer as far as <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to congratulate his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to tender the reſpects and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the City to him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him courteouſly, returns hearty thanks to the City, but nothing ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of what they expected: ſo that hitherto, and long after he marched hooded in alluſion to his name; no man could tell what to make of him, nor what his deſign, or the end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, but men gueſſed and hoped, according as their opinions and deſires were: but the <hi>Rump</hi> both now, and long after, were as confidently aſſured of him, as of any man within their own walls.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:116047:64"/>
            <p>Paſſing through <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably received by the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Northern Gentlemen, who had not many dayes before contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much to the reducing of a party of <hi>Lamberts</hi> Officers and Souldiers, that had poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While <hi>Monck</hi> was there, divers of the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentlemen were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to underſtand his intentions, and to that purpoſe, requeſted Sir <hi>Henry Cholmely</hi> one of their number, to go to him and talk privately with him; which he did, &amp; had conveniencie of diſcourſe with him. At his return they were big with expectation, and demanded of him what he thought of the General; He told them he thought he was like the Peace of God; they asking why? He anſwers, becauſe he paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. This I was credibly in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Miniſter, living in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Coming along all the way to Saint <hi>Albones,</hi> he receives ſeveral Addreſſes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116047:64"/>from all or moſt of the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> all importing their humble deſires, that either the Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers might be called in, or that the Houſe may be filled up by new electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo one way or other, they might have again a full and free Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; the want of which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be the cauſe of all their late ſufferings, and frequent changes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the oppreſſion of the people, and high diſhonor of the Engliſh Nation. He receives them all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, treats them civilly, but for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer tells them, <hi>That he was but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Parliament, and that only in a Military capacity; that it became not him to interpoſe in Civil affairs; that the Parliament he doubted not, would do them right, and ſatisfie their juſt deſires: That for the calling in of the Secluded Members, the Parliament had already given judgement in that point, and they ought to acquieſce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; But for the filing up the Houſe,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116047:65"/>he told them it was now under debate, and doubted not but they ſhould receive full ſatisfaction therein; and therefore he exhorts them to attend with patience the determinations of the Houſe, and not by any unſeaſonable importunity to diſturbe their Counſels, which might be a meanes to delay their ſatisfaction, and the ſettlement of the Nation, which</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>was now intended, and ready to be effected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Devonſhire</hi> alſo (though far remote out of his way) he receives the like Addreſs (one of the firſt that were tendred to him) wherein after complaint made of their greivances, they earneſtly deſire the calling in of the ſecluded Members. But to them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Countrymen, and ſome of them near allied to him) he returns by way of anſwer, a courteous Letter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in amongh other things, he tels them, that the calling in of the ſecluded Members could not ſafely be yielded to, moſt of them being known to be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116047:65"/>Aſſertors of Monarchy; He gives them ſeveral Reaſons, ſhewing, that as the caſe of affairs now ſtood, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was utterly inconſiſtent with this Nation: That a Republick or Free State was the only Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein the ſeveral intereſts of the Nation, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil might be beſt preſerved: And therefore in the concluſion, he deſires them that by their impatiencies they would not obſtruct the Parliaments conſultations, otherwiſe (ſaies he) our peace will be ſo much the longer a ſtranger to us, and we thereby made a prey to our ſelves and forreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This was from <hi>Leiceſter, Jan.</hi> 23. and ſoon after this Letter was printed and publiſhed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Intelligencer.</p>
            <p>Thus giving fair and plauſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all ſuch as addreſſed themſelves unto him, he marches along and comes to Saint <hi>Albones</hi> about the latter end of <hi>January;</hi> where ſtill Addreſſes are
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116047:66"/>made to him out of <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk,</hi> and other places, which receive the like anſwers that others did. But theſe Addreſſes (ye muſt know) were alſo tendred to the Parliament, though ſome that tendred them, were clapt by the heels for their pains (as the <hi>Berk-ſhire</hi> Gentlemen) and others threatned; whereas Water-men of <hi>London,</hi> for a congratulatory Addreſs made to them at the ſame time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſolemn thanks of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>While he was at Saint <hi>Albones,</hi> ſome Aldermen and Common-Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are ſent to him from the City of <hi>London,</hi> to congratulate his coming, and court him; but are returned as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, with thanks for their reſpects.</p>
            <p>From Saint <hi>Albones</hi> he removes to <hi>Barnet,</hi> where he makes a ſtay, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to come to <hi>London,</hi> until <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Souldiers were out of the City. Mean-time Saint <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his Lodging, and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116047:66"/>Cuſtody of the Park is voted to him, to hold during the pleaſure of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with ſome other like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, a magnificent Reward for ſuch an undertaking.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers that were late <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,</hi> being voided the City, <hi>Monk</hi> and his Army marches to <hi>London,</hi> on Friday, <hi>February</hi> 3. and is lodged at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> at whoſe coming, there is great joy and triumphing all over the City.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday following, <hi>Febr.</hi> 8. The City continuing ſtill in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorineſs and oppoſition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they meet in Common-Council, and there paſs a Vote or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Not to pay or levy any Taxes, until ſuch time as they may have a full and free Parliament: For hitherto you muſt know, the <hi>Rump</hi> had not agreed upon qualifications for filling up the Houſe; and many thought they never intended it; but only to eſtabliſh themſelves in perpetual authority.</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:116047:67"/>
            <p>Upon this Vote or Reſolve of the Common-Council, the <hi>Rump</hi> are highly offended, and ſend a ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Monk</hi> to march the next day with his Army into the City; To pull up their chains and poſts, to break down the gates and portcullis of the City; to impriſon forwith in the Tower divers Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, that were conceived to be chiefly active in paſſing thoſe Votes. This command of theirs, <hi>Monk</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes next day, <hi>Febr.</hi> 9. to the great terror and amazement, not only of the City, but of the whole Nation and Kingdom, when they heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it: All hearts are ſaddened, and now moſt men conclude, that <hi>Monk</hi> is not the man deſigned of God for the delivery of this oppreſſed Nation.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen in the ſeveral Counties that had ſubſcribed and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their Addreſſes and Declarations, begin now to fear their own Stakes; there being in ſome of their Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116047:67"/>expreſſions againſt paying taxes without a free Parliament: It had (I muſt tell alſo you) before this, been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Houſe, that thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that tendred theſe Addreſſes, might be ſequeſtred; yet at that time, it was carried in the Negative. They had cauſe to fear alſo, that if they intended at all to fill up the Houſe by new Elections, they would impoſe ſuch qualifications, as ſhould exclude all ſuch Gentlemen in all Counties, as either ſubſcribed or delivered theſe Addreſſes: and ſo the greateſt part by far of the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> would be made incapable of ſerving their Country, and conſequently the filling up of the Houſe by ſuch a choice, as would then be allowed, would be but a means further to enſlave both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterities.</p>
            <p>For theſe and the like conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they had ſome thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in moſt Counties (as it was reported) to ſecond their Addreſſes or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116047:68"/>Declarations with Arms, thereby to vindicate their Native Rights from the oppreſſion of a Combination of Tyrants, who had a long time uſurped the ſupream power of the Nation, and were now perpetuating that uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the free-born people, to their utter ſlavery and oppreſſion. And it was verily conceived, that had not the face of affairs ſuddenly changed, by <hi>Monks</hi> unhooding himſelf, the whole Kingdom would ſoon have been put into a general flame of combuſtion: for the City of <hi>London,</hi> by this late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, were rather incenſed than awed: though their Gates and Portculleſſes were broken, yet their hearts and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages remained entire, and were the more confirmed and hardened: and had the Counties unanimouſly riſen, it is like the <hi>Londoners</hi> would not have ſit ſtill: for the whole Kingdom was generally exaſperated againſt the <hi>Rump;</hi> and the diſperſed ſouldiers of <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army, not knowing where
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:116047:68"/>to quarter, nor how to live, might probably be thought willing to adhere to any party, that were in a capacity to entertain them with pay.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rump</hi> (as it is conceived) by putting <hi>Monk</hi> upon that baſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of being their City-Scavenger, had a deſign not only to terrifie and curb the City, but alſo to make <hi>Monk</hi> and his Army odious and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, whereby they might engage him hereafter more firmly to themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monk</hi> having thus executed the Commands of the <hi>Rump,</hi> he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his mind at it. And upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday following, <hi>Febr.</hi> 11. he draws his Army into <hi>Finsbury</hi> Fields, and ſending for the Lord Mayor and ſome of the chief Citizens, he had ſome diſcourſe with them: And preſently after, he writes a Letter to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as from <hi>White-hall,</hi> wherein he tels them, that he had done their commands, though not without ſome
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116047:69"/>regret; never any ſuch thing having in all theſe late troubles, been done to that City, ſo eminent for their aſſiſtance and adherency to Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; He minded them, that the end of his coming and firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as appears in his Declaration, was not only to preſerve them in their preſent power, but to vindicate the liberties and priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the Native rights and freedom of the people; That he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſome perſons impeached of high Treaſon, were yet ſuffered to ſit in the Houſe: That <hi>Lambert,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and others, perſons of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous principles, and highly guilty of the late diſſention of the Army, and of the horrid force put upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were yet ſuffered to be in and about the City: That though they had voted the continuance of the ſetled maintenance of Miniſters, yet they were now upon contriving of another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement that would force many of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116047:69"/>moſt conſcientious of them, from the enjoyment of their Means: That there had been too many oaths already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Nation, and that they had more need to mourn for the breach of oaths, than to impoſe new ones. And that he obſerved, that thoſe men were moſt forward to impoſe oaths, who made leaſt conſcience of keeping them: He minded them alſo of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of dangerous conſequence, that they had lately received and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced from the <hi>Fanatick</hi> party. Theſe and ſome other grievances he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, and then adds his humble deſires, that they would by Friday following iſſue out Writs for filling up their Houſe by new Elections, with due and reaſonable qualifications; And that they would put a certain and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy period to their preſent ſitting, whereby the People may enjoy the benefit of ſucceſſive Parliaments which is (ſaith he) the undoubted right of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. And in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116047:70"/>the purſuance of theſe things, he will not fail to ſtand by them and aſſiſt them to the utmoſt of his power with all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. to this effect (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) was his Letter ſigned by himſelf and the chief Officers of his Army, as from <hi>White-hall, Febr.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>This highly pleaſed and rejoyced the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and made full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the former rigidity done them: <hi>Monk</hi> herein granting the full of what they formerly deſired or expected from him. It was as great cauſe of joy to the whole Kingdom, as to the City. All that Saturday afternoon, there was Ringing, and Bonefires, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, till twelve of the clock at night, and feaſting <hi>Monks</hi> Officers and Souldiers with wine and good chear; nothing was too dear for them. At <hi>Norwich</hi> and in all places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at the firſt report of the News, there was the like rejoicing and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, in hope of a free Parliament. So much was the <hi>Rump</hi> in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116047:70"/>of the people, as they deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to be rid of them.</p>
            <p>Soon after <hi>Monk</hi> had thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf, and joyned with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and whole Kingdom in their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, The ſecluded Members (who a great many of them had been all this time in and about <hi>London</hi>) addreſſed themſelves to him: he deſires a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be had between them and ſome of the <hi>Rump:</hi> they meet ten in number of either ſide, to argue and debate the buſineſs: One challenging admiſſion as Members of the Houſe, and unjuſtly before excluded: the other refuſing to admit the, unleſs they will confirm all that was done ſince their excluſion as juſt and lawful, or at leaſtwiſe engage (as themſelves had done) againſt a ſingle Perſon or Houſe of Lords. Two ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they had about this debate, but could not agree.</p>
            <p>A day or two after, <hi>Monk</hi> cals the ſecluded Members alone, and demands
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116047:71"/>of them, if they were ſtill firm and conſtant in their reſolution of not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging againſt a ſingle Perſon; they anſwer him, yea; and that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable in that reſolution. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he cals them altogether, a matter of fourſcore of them (almoſt twice the number of thoſe that ſate) goes along with them, and puts them into the Parliament-Houſe, to ſit with the reſt of the Members, <hi>Febr.</hi> 21. being Tueſday: having firſt delivered to ſome of the <hi>Rump,</hi> a paper written to prevent miſtakes, wherein he declares, That after ſeveral debates had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he had now received ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſatisfaction from thoſe worthy Gentlemen that were ſecluded former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But he yet expreſſed his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion and judgement, to be for a Common-wealth or free State, and gave ſome reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>The ſecluded Members being thus reſtored, who had for eleven years and more been kept out from diſcharging
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116047:71"/>their truſt, there is great rejoycing and triumphing again both in <hi>London</hi> and all parts of the Kingdom, with Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Bonefires making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſome of the <hi>Rump</hi> upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring, (it is ſaid) withdrew and would ſit no more.</p>
            <p>Preſently after their reſtoring, they vote <hi>Monk</hi> to be General of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> (one of the ſecluded Members, to be Leiutenant-General, and <hi>Roſsiter</hi> a <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> Gentleman, (and one that had formerly ſerved the Parliament) to be General of the Horſe. They conſtitute <hi>Montagu</hi> to be Admiral at Sea, inſtead of <hi>Lawſon;</hi> and they appoint a new Council of State. Soon after they make an Act for ſetling the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, together with ſome Acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Miniſters. And taking order for calling of a new Parliament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene at <hi>Weſtminſter, April</hi> 25. they diſſolve themſelves on <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:116047:72"/>
            <p>And thus by Gods great bleſſing, we have lived to ſee an end of that unhappy long Parliament, that hath been the cauſe of miſery and calamity to theſe three late flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, for theſe nineteen years and more laſt paſt. And all this brought to paſs without one drop of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by the prudent and politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of General <hi>Monk,</hi> who with a ſmall Army (an handful of men in compariſon) not paſt four thouſand foot and eighteen hundred horſe, and thoſe not very well accommodated, marched from <hi>Berwick</hi> through the heart of <hi>England,</hi> to the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> without the leaſt oppoſition, and at length gained the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of that opulent and potent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Lamberts</hi> Army being at leaſt twelve or thirteen thouſand men, well horſ'd and well appointed, breaking in pieces and mouldring away in a moment; the Troops and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies marching from place to place,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116047:72"/>where they might find quarter, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards moſt of them (their Officers caſhierd) were received and liſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of General <hi>Monk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards by degrees he purges his Army, putting out all Anabaptiſts, Quakers, and other Fanaticks, both Officers and common Souldiers, as they are or can be diſcoverd, both in the Army and Gariſons, and placeth others in their ſteads. <hi>Overton</hi> a fifth Monarchy-man, who pretended to hold <hi>Hull</hi> for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was yet notwithſtanding commanded to ſurrender it to Mr. <hi>Charls Fairfax,</hi> a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he did: and the like was done in all other Gariſons, the Army-men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of other confiding perſons put in their ſteads.</p>
            <p>Soon after the putting in of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Members, <hi>Lambert</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower: <hi>Haſelrig, Scot,</hi> and others are under examination, but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116047:73"/>diſmiſſed, upon their promiſe or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to demean themſelves peaceably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> not long after finds means to eſcape out of the Tower, and about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> or ſoon after, appears in Arms about <hi>Northampton,</hi> in the head of a party, many of the caſhierd Officers and Souldiers of the Fanatick and diſcontented party, being got together. And it is generally conceived, that all the Anabaptiſts, Quakers, and other factious people in all parts of the Kingdom, had a deſign to have riſen and joyned with him, had he not been timely ſuppreſſed. But Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> being ſent againſt him with a party, he ſurrounds them all, (being not above five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred), whereupon moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers come in, and yield themſelves; and <hi>Lambert</hi> with ſome Commanders are taken upon the place, without a ſtroke ſtriking, only a ſcour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116047:73"/>of <hi>Lamberts</hi> (they ſay) was ſlain. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Okey</hi> and ſome others eſcaped by flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>lambert</hi> being thus taken, is brought to <hi>London</hi> together with Colonel <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Major <hi>Creed;</hi> and young <hi>Haſelrig,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> Son. Theſe were all brought up in a Coach through <hi>Hide Park,</hi> on Tueſday, <hi>April.</hi> 29. what time there was the greateſt general Muſter of Citizens that ever was ſeen in or near <hi>London:</hi> Of trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men and Auxiliaries there were at leaſt twenty thouſand (ſome ſay thirty thouſand) men in Armes; Some of the Nobility, and many Gentlemen of quality trayling pikes voluntarily amongſt them. The Priſoners brought through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſufficiently hooted at, they afterwards drove the Coach under <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there made a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116047:74"/>ſtand. This was done (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to minde them of their deſtiny, or at leaſt of their deſert, and to diſgrace them, who had ſo long time inſulted and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineered over the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Commonalty of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. A juſt reward to uſe them uncivilly, who had ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly abuſed both King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The Parliament according to Appointment, began at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, April</hi> the twenty fifth, the Houſe of Commons being elected and called by Writs, iſſuing out in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, (a Title invented preſently upon the change of the Government from as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to a Common-wealth in the year one thouſand ſix hundred forty
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116047:74"/>eight) the Lords and Peers of the upper Houſe taking their places by vertue of their birth-rights and ancient dignities.</p>
            <p>Soon after the ſitting of the Parliament, there arrived at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> and Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> with a Declaration from his Majeſty, as alſo ſeveral Letters. One to the Houſe of of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; another to the Houſe of Commons; a third to the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and a fourth to General <hi>Monk,</hi> to be by him communicated to the Council of State, and to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the ſeveral Armies under his Command: which Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeveral Letters from his Majeſty, were preſented according to their ſeveral directions, <hi>May</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <pb n="421" facs="tcp:116047:75"/>
            <p>In his Declaration, he offers, 1. A general Pardon to all of all ſorts, excepting only ſuch as the Parliament ſhould think fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: provided, that they ſue out their Pardons under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> within fourty dayes after the publication thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He offers a Liberty to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences for matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo far forth as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould think fit; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch an Act as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that purpoſe ſhall tender to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the ſales and purchaſes of Lands made ſince theſe late troubles, he is willing to leave it to the determination of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom he preſumes beſt able to provide for the ſatisfaction of all ſuch as are concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <pb n="143" facs="tcp:116047:75"/>
            <p>And Laſtly, he promiſeth full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Arrears to all Officers and Souldiers of General <hi>Monck</hi>'s Army, and to receive them into his ſervice upon as good pay and conditions, as they now enjoy. This was the ſum of his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, publiſhed at <hi>Breda, April</hi> 14. 1660. in the twelfth year of his Majeſties Reign.</p>
            <p>This Declaration together with his ſeveral Letters afore-mentioned, were highly accepted. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council, after the reading of them, cried out unanimouſly, God ſave King <hi>Charls;</hi> and preſently took down the Common-wealths Arms that hung in the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and (as they ſay) brake them in pieces, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the King Arms to be hung up in their place, and gave ſolemn thanks by their Recorder to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Meſſengers.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:116047:76"/>
            <p>The Lords received their Letter, by the Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> with the like joy and loyal affection. The Houſe of Commons having read their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Declaration, voted it ſatisfactory; and preſently voted the Government of the Nation to be in his Majeſty, as the rightful and undoubted heir of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> They ordered alſo a Committee to meet for drawing up a Letter of thanks to his Majeſty for his moſt gracions Declaration: And to Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Letter, they gave five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound as a gratuity to buy him a Jewel.</p>
            <p>Both they and the Lords further ordered, that ſix of the upper Houſe, and fifteen of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould be forthwith ſent to his Majeſty, to invite and attend him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:116047:76"/>to <hi>England. Montague</hi> the Admiral at Sea is commanded to wait upon him, with a Squadron of Ships, and fifry thouſand pound is ordered for his Majeſtjes expences, as alſo ten thouſand pound to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and five thouſand pound to the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Letter alſo and Declaration to the Army, gave no leſſer ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction both to the General, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers; they all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly owning his Majeſty in an high degree.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the eighth of <hi>May,</hi> the King was ſolemnly proclaimed in <hi>London,</hi> with the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and acclamations of Joy that poſſibly could be; and the like was ſoon after done in all Counties, Cities, Corporations, and inlet Towns all over <hi>England.</hi> No King
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:116047:77"/>ever coming to his Throne, with ſo great ſatisfaction and rejoycing of the People; thereby giving an evident Demonſtration to the world, that it was not the People of <hi>England,</hi> nor the Parliament or Repreſentatives of the People, but only a factious and ſeditious party, encouraged and ſupported by a perfidious and traiterous Army, that murdered the late King, diſinherited his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and overthrew the ancient Fundamental and well conſtituted government of the Nation, turning it from a Monarchy to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and thereby occaſioned theſe horrid confuſions, and frequent changes and reelings of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that afterwards enſued, to the high reproach and diſhonour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. For no ſooner were the People and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> by the mercy of God, delivered from the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallage
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:116047:77"/>of an imperious and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering Army, and put in a condition of freedom, but they preſently return to their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and call in the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heir of the Crown, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Government, with the greateſt cheerfulneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing that could be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>And thus God who only doth wonders, hath wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully for this ſinful Nation, turning our Captivity, as the Rivers in the South, ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gently, calmly, without any tumult or torrent, after ſo many horrid confuſions, as we have lain under for ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, even to the wonder and aſtoniſhment, not only of our ſelves, but of all the Neighbour Nations round about us; who muſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116047:78"/>needs acknowledge in our behalf, (as was ſometimes done in the caſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) that the Lord hath done great things for them; and we muſt needs with the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> anſwer, by way of eccho, Yea the Lord hath done great thing for us already whereof we rejoyce, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 126. The People of <hi>England</hi> were never conceived or reported to be ſo much againſt their King, as now they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear to be for him; even all of all ſorts, but ſuch only whoſe guilt makes them deſperate, like <hi>Cain,</hi> thinking their wickedneſs greater then can be forgiven. And here for a concluſion, we may fitly and truly (in a ſence) take take up that ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, and apply it to the preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The ſame ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the Corner: This is the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116047:78"/>Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
